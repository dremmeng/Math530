Exercise 7.8 (a)
Test whether PH value of a certain chemical is to be controlled at 5
H0: The mean ph as no changed from the target value of 5
H1: The mean Ph as changed from the target value of 5 $\\$
(b)
```{r}
ME=1
sigma=1
(2.576^2+sigma^2)/ME^2
```
(c)
```{r}
z=(4.915-5)/(.2/sqrt(16))
pnorm(z,mean=0,sd=1)
```
Here p value is less than .1 so we reject $H_{0}$.
$\\$
Exercise 7.10 (a)
$H_{0}$ The speedometers have no bias.
$H_1$ The Speedometers have bias.
$\\$
(b)
```{r}
(2.326+1.645)^2*1^2/(55.5-55)^(2)
```
(c)
```{r}
Z=(55.2-55)/(.8/sqrt(64))
Z
pnorm(Z,0,1)
```
Since 2 is less than 2.326 we fail to reject $H_{0}$. We can not conclude that the speedmeter have a bias.
$\\$
(d)
```{r}
Z=2.326-(55.5-55)/(.8/sqrt(50))
1-pnorm(Z,0,1)
```
