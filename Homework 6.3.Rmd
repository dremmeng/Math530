Exercise 7.18 (a)
```{r}
n=17
mu=476.4
sigma=1.0
s=.7
t=(n-1)*(s/sigma)^2
t
df=n-1
pchisq(t,df=df)
```
Since p value =.05 we reject the null hypotgesis so the new machine has a statistically significant less variation than the current machiune. 
$//$
(b)
```{r}
(((n-1)*(s)^2)/qchisq(.95,df=df))^(.5)
```
