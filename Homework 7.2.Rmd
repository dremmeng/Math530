Exercise 8.9 (a)
```{r}
(8-6.5)-2.021*sqrt(3.25*(2/21))
(8-6.5)+2.021*sqrt(3.25*(2/21))
```
(b)
```{r}
(8-6.5)+2.032*sqrt((2.1213^2)/21+(1.4142^2)/21)
(8-6.5)-2.032*sqrt((2.1213^2)/21+(1.4142^2)/21)
```
Exercise 8.14 (a)
```{r}
t1=qt(.95,25)
t2=qt(.05,25)
(27.5-25.5)+t1*sqrt(2/25)
(27.5-25.5)-t1*sqrt(2/25)

```
(b)
```{r}
t1=qt(.95,25)
37.3-30.6+t1*sqrt(13/25)
37.3-30.6-t1*sqrt(13/25)
```
(c)
We can conclude it is more difficult to handle a high volume during the holidays.
